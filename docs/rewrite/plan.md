# Plan

Seven parts. Each one ships on its own and leaves the plugin working. Tracked as
checkboxes in
[issue #114](https://github.com/streamyfin/jellyfin-plugin-streamyfin/issues/114),
which stays the source of truth for progress. This document holds the reasoning
that does not fit in a checkbox.

App side counterpart: [streamyfin/streamyfin](https://github.com/streamyfin/streamyfin).

## Decisions already taken

**Breaking change with a migration.** New config model, one time migration that
reads the old XML at startup. Old routes stay as compatibility shims until the
app fleet has moved. The pattern is copied from intro-skipper's
[#871](https://github.com/intro-skipper/intro-skipper/pull/871): read only import
of the old store, an `ImportHistory` marker, an atomic commit, a retry on the next
start if it fails, and the old file left untouched as the rollback path.

**Three targeting levels.** Server default, then plugin defined groups, then per
user. The server resolves the three and serves the effective set, with secrets
filtered out for non admins. Jellyfin has a `Group` entity in `JellyfinDbContext`
with permissions and preferences, but nothing uses it, no manager, no controller,
no route, so the groups are defined by the plugin rather than borrowed from a
dormant entity the server may reshape.

**Plugin and app move together.** Two repositories, one project.

**Dual Jellyfin support via an MSBuild switch**, the same approach as the
JavaScript Injector plugin: one branch, a `JellyfinTarget` property flipping
`TargetFramework` and package versions, CI building twice. The alternative,
intro-skipper's branch per Jellyfin major, means porting every fix by hand
forever. Dropping 10.11 later means deleting one `PropertyGroup`, one matrix
entry and the compat folder.

**Everything version specific lives in one folder**, behind `#if`, enforced by a
test that fails the build if a version conditional appears anywhere else. The
constraint is deletability, and a rule that is not executable decays in six
months.

**Generated admin forms.** `@json-editor/json-editor` 2.15.2 is already vendored
in `Pages/Libraries/` and imported by nothing. Simple settings render from the
JSON schema the plugin already publishes. The home editor and the group targeting
screen were to stay hand written, which held for one of the two and not for the
other, as the paragraph below records. That hybrid is what KefinTweaks landed on in
`scripts/configuration.js`: descriptor driven for the repetitive fields, hand
written where the shape is genuinely irregular.

Half of that held. **The targeting screen went the other way**: its list, its
member picker and its editing flow are hand written, but the settings a group
overrides are the same generated form, because by the time P3.3 was built P3.1
had made one that worked and a second editor written by hand would have been
duplication. The line is not "irregular shape, write it by hand" but "the settings
themselves are always the schema's job". See
[admin-ui-targeting.md](admin-ui-targeting.md).

## How it lands

`develop` is the integration branch, `main` keeps serving the published plugin.
One branch per sub part named `refonte/pX-N-slug`, one pull request onto
`develop`, chained with `gh stack` so each pull request shows only its own layer.

Order: **P0**, then **P1**, then **P2** and **P3** in parallel, then **P4**,
**P5**, **P6** in whatever order suits.

Two ordering constraints inside P0 that are not obvious:

- **P0.11 before P0.2.** Do not switch CI on over a suite that fails on Windows
  and on any non English machine. Red that everybody ignores is worse than no CI.
- **P0.12 after P0.5.** The warning policy pass must not annotate nullability in
  `Storage/`, since P0.5 deletes that folder.

## P0. Foundation

Two artifacts from one source, and the storage layer moved to EF Core before
anything is built on top of it. Nothing changes for the user.

- **P0.1** `JellyfinTarget` switch (`jf11` = net9.0 + Jellyfin 10.11, `jf12` =
  net10.0 + Jellyfin 12), single compat folder, test that fails on a stray `#if`
  outside it
- **P0.11** Make the test suite pass outside an English Linux box
- **P0.2** `build.yml`: build and test both targets on every pull request and
  push, upload DLL artifacts
- **P0.3** EF Core `DbContext`, baseline migration, `IDesignTimeDbContextFactory`,
  database file under `IApplicationPaths`
- **P0.4** Move device tokens off `Storage/` onto EF, one time read only import of
  the old database, old file left untouched
- **P0.5** Drop the direct `Microsoft.Data.Sqlite` usage and the hand written SQL
- **P0.6** Reworked `release.yml`: matrix produces one zip per target, a single
  GitHub release carries both
- **P0.7** Two manifests with their own `targetAbi` and checksum, keeping the
  current URL for 10.11 so no configured server breaks
- **P0.8** Script cleanup: manifest deduplication, zip path derived from the TFM
  instead of the hardcoded `net9.0`, `Jellyfin.Controller` pinned to each line's
  floor rather than `10.11.*-*`
- **P0.9** Set `owner` in `manifest.json` to the organisation instead of a
  personal account
- **P0.10** Optional: SignPath artifact signing, free for open source
- **P0.12** Warning policy, once P0.5 has removed `Storage/`
- **P0.13** The three `CS4014` fire and forget calls in the notification handlers

Two findings from P0 that changed the shape of the rest:

The plugin **compiles against Jellyfin 12 with zero source changes**. The compat
folder starts empty. `net9.0` to `net10.0` is the only structural break, and
everything the plugin consumes, `IUserManager`, `ILibraryManager`,
`IServerConfigurationManager`, `IApplicationPaths`, `IPluginServiceRegistrator`
and the `BaseItemKind`, `ItemSortBy`, `ItemFilter`, `SubtitlePlaybackMode` enums,
exists unchanged in both.

`IUserManager.Users` became `IUserManager.GetUsers()` in **10.11.9**, a breaking
change inside a patch line, so the floor for the 10.11 artifact is 10.11.9 and
not 10.11.0. Still wider than the published manifest, which demands 10.11.11 by
accident.

Also settled here: both versions register
`AddPooledDbContextFactory<JellyfinDbContext>`, so a plugin can inject
`IDbContextFactory<JellyfinDbContext>`, but that is the server's own context and
its migrations belong to the server. The plugin owns its own SQLite database
either way. There is no cleaner story on 12 worth waiting for.

## P1. Settings model

The core. Everything after this depends on it.

- **P1.1** Typed settings schema carrying, per key: value, lock, and a secret
  marker
- **P1.2** Plugin defined groups: table, user assignment, API
- **P1.3** Resolution engine global to group to user, with precedence tests
- **P1.4** Output filtering: secrets go to admins only, everything else resolved
  for the caller
- **P1.5** One time migration of the old XML config
- **P1.6** New routes, old ones kept as shims

P1.4 is the fix for the finding at the top of
[state-of-the-plugin.md](state-of-the-plugin.md): today `GET config` hands the
whole configuration, Seerr admin key included, to every authenticated account.
It is also what closes #69, since only the server can decide which sections a
given user is allowed to know exist.

The shape of P1 was proposed by the maintainers themselves in
[#29](https://github.com/streamyfin/jellyfin-plugin-streamyfin/issues/29), well
before this rewrite was scoped. See [issue-triage.md](issue-triage.md).

## P2. App on the new contract

- **P2.1** Consume the server resolved effective set instead of the raw map
- **P2.2** Keep the three existing semantics: locked, pushed once as a default,
  free
- **P2.3** Tolerate a server still on the old format during rollout
- **P2.4** Remove the hardcoded rule that forces `searchEngine` to Streamystats
  when `streamyStatsServerUrl` is set

P2.2 is the one that is easy to lose. The app has two distinct behaviours today,
not one. A `locked` setting is enforced on read, through `effectiveSettingsAtom`,
and on write, through `updateSettings`. An unlocked plugin value is applied
exactly once, through `pendingPluginDefaults` and the `PLUGIN_APPLIED_DEFAULTS`
registry, so the admin proposes a starting value and the user stays free to change
it afterwards. Collapsing those two into one flag would take away an admin's
ability to suggest without imposing. The schema in P1.1 must carry all three
states: locked, pushed once, unmanaged.

## P3. Generated admin UI

- **P3.1** Render simple settings from the JSON schema using the already vendored
  json-editor
- **P3.2** Hand written editor for home sections
- **P3.3** Screen for group and user targeting. Written as "hand written", and
  delivered on the generated form instead: once P3.1 existed, a second settings editor
  written by hand was duplication. See
  [admin-ui-targeting.md](admin-ui-targeting.md)
- **P3.4** JSON export and import
- **P3.5** Decide between embedded pages and `jellyfin-plugin-pages`. Settled: they stay embedded
- **P3.6** Draw the form ourselves. Added after P3.3 was seen on the beta: json-editor's
  property picker never added a setting, its DOM could only be styled from the
  outside, and a `locked` box shows two states where the app has three. The server
  describes the form, the plugin draws it. Both settings tabs run on it, and
  json-editor is gone with the schema reshaping that existed for it. See
  [admin-ui-renderer.md](admin-ui-renderer.md)

P3.4 carries more than the configuration. The targeting levels are the work, and
they live in the plugin's own database rather than in Jellyfin's XML, so nothing a
server administrator backs up today carries them. The file holds the credentials
the configuration holds, because a backup that cannot restore a working server is
not one, and the page says so before it hands it over.

P3.5 is settled, and the measurement settled it. The pages stay embedded. What
looked like a reason to move, the fifteen megabyte DLL, turned out to be Monaco
rather than the pages: this plugin's own pages are 168 KB and the vendored editor
and its three web workers are 14.8 MB. Moving to File Transformation would have
moved the 168 KB and left the rest.

What staying keeps: `IHasWebPages` is Jellyfin's own interface, it works on both
lines this plugin targets, and it needs nothing installed beside it.
`jellyfin-plugin-pages` and `jellyfin-plugin-custom-tabs` are built on File
Transformation, which an administrator would have to install first, and reaching
it means reflection across `AssemblyLoadContext` boundaries because every plugin
loads into its own.

The size is a separate question and it is Monaco: a code editor with a language
server and completion, shipped so an administrator can edit the one part of the
configuration the form does not draw. Once P3.2 gives the home sections an editor
of their own the Yaml tab is a fallback, and fifteen megabytes for a fallback is
the wrong shape. Worth revisiting then, against CodeMirror, which does the same
job for about 200 KB.

**Server side validation** is not a numbered sub part and landed alongside P3.6:
`SettingsValidation` refuses a value outside the `[Bounds]` a setting declares, on the
YAML save and on both targeting writes, reading the same declaration the form draws
from. What it does not catch is `value: null` on a whole number, which YamlDotNet reads
as `0`; that needs the raw document rather than the deserialised settings.

## P4. Push notifications

- **P4.1** Inject `IHttpClientFactory` with a named client and a timeout
- **P4.2** Read Expo receipts and prune `DeviceNotRegistered` tokens, and the error
  tickets that say the same thing at send time
- **P4.3** Batching, honour 429 and `Retry-After`, retry with backoff
- **P4.4** Declared events instead of the four hardcoded ones
- **P4.5** Per user notification preferences, on top of P1

P4.2 is the one with user-visible consequences. Expo reports a dead token twice
and the plugin read neither: as an error ticket at send time, whose
`details.error` is `DeviceNotRegistered`, and later through `/push/getReceipts`,
which nothing ever called. So tokens accumulated forever and sends went nowhere.

The paragraph that stood here said the receipts were the only source. Building it
proved otherwise, which is written down rather than quietly corrected: the ticket
is the cheaper of the two, since it arrives with the send and needs nothing
stored, and it was in the response the whole time behind a field typed `object`.

P4.3 turned out to be two separate holes rather than one. Expo takes a hundred
recipients per request, counted across the whole body, and the plugin sent every
device on the server in one: a library addition on a server with more than a
hundred registered devices was refused whole, so nobody was notified rather than
everybody. And a 429, which Expo answers past six hundred notifications a second
for a project, was read as a delivery with nothing to report, so the notification
was lost with a line in a log nobody reads. A library adding fifty episodes at
once is the shape that reaches both.

P4.4 absorbs #29, #34 and #30, and each needs an explicit decision rather than an
open ended promise. See [issue-triage.md](issue-triage.md).

## P5. Custom home

- **P5.1** Replace the four nullable siblings (`items`, `nextUp`, `latest`,
  `custom`) with a discriminated type
- **P5.2** Server side section validation with errors the UI can show
- **P5.3** Dedicated reorderable section editor with a preview
- **P5.4** Per group section targeting, once P1 is in
- **P5.5** Migrate existing configurations

P5.1 is what unblocks #78, #21 and every future section kind. Adding a kind used
to mean adding a fifth nullable sibling that nothing said was exclusive with the
other four. P5.3 needs the explicit `order` field from #93 to have somewhere to
write to.

P5.1 kept the payload names. Every copy of the app in the field reads `items`,
`nextUp`, `latest` and `custom` by name, so renaming them would have emptied the
home screen of everyone who had not updated. What changed is that the section now
says which one it is, exactly one is allowed, and the server refuses a layout
that breaks either rule.

P5.5 turned out to be nothing to migrate. A section written before the kind
existed carries one payload, which is an unambiguous answer, so it is read as one
rather than refused. No configuration is rewritten and no version is stamped: the
kind is filled in on the way out, and the stored copy gains it whenever an
administrator next saves.

## P6. Third party integrations

- **P6.1** Group integrations into typed blocks instead of flat keys
- **P6.2** Server side connection probe with a test button in the admin UI
- **P6.3** Expose health so the app knows an integration is down
- **P6.4** Replace the hidden Streamystats rule with a declared one

P6.2 belongs on the server, which can reach an internal URL a phone never will.
The app's `utils/serverUrl/probes/reachability.ts` is the pattern to follow, and
it was followed rather than improved on: Seerr has an unauthenticated endpoint
that identifies the service, the other two have nothing of the sort, and for
those any HTTP answer at all is the most that can honestly be claimed.

P6.3 is the same probes read by a different caller. The app changes what it
offers by whether an integration answers, and a tab that opens onto nothing is
worse than one that says the server is not answering. No answer carries a URL or
a key, so a user learns that an integration is down without learning where it
lives, which is the distinction P1.4 exists to keep.

P6.1 is also the moment to rename the `jellyseerr*` keys to `seerr*` with the old
names kept as aliases, which closes #95 without breaking every existing YAML.

The rename landed first, on its own, and the typed blocks did not. Reading is
where the rename matters: an administrator writes `seerrServerUrl`, the plugin
now answers to it, and #95 was that it did not and said nothing. Writing is where
it cannot move yet, because every copy of the app in the field reads
`jellyseerrServerUrl` by name and a plugin that wrote the other spelling would
take Seerr away from everyone who had not updated. So the old name stays the one
written, the new one is an alias on the way in, and the day the app reads the new
name the canonical one moves without a second migration for anyone who typed
either.

Typed blocks are the same wall, one storey higher. `seerr.serverUrl` is a
different shape rather than a different spelling, and no alias makes an app that
reads a flat key find a nested one. That part waits for the app, and it is the
one piece of P6 that does.

## P1.7. Settings parity

The plugin declares 43 of the 95 settings the app reads, so more than half of
what the app offers is outside an administrator's reach. P1.1 and P1.3 hold no
list of their own, so declaring a property is the whole of the work.

Those two numbers come from `AppSettingsManifest.json` rather than a grep. The
hand counts that stood here first said 45 and 93, and were wrong in opposite
directions: the grep matched two properties that were commented out, and the awk
missed a key declared outside the range it scanned.

The decision about the 52 undeclared keys, the rules a declaration follows, and
the manifest that stops the gap reopening are in
[settings-parity.md](settings-parity.md).

Not a numbered sub part, landed alongside P1:
[#130](https://github.com/streamyfin/jellyfin-plugin-streamyfin/pull/130), the
plugin's entry in the dashboard's left menu, and
[#109](https://github.com/streamyfin/jellyfin-plugin-streamyfin/pull/109), the
two lockable mute subtitle keys that came out of the pull request triage.

Also not numbered:
[#137](https://github.com/streamyfin/jellyfin-plugin-streamyfin/pull/137), which made
the two language settings saveable at all, and
[#138](https://github.com/streamyfin/jellyfin-plugin-streamyfin/pull/138), which says in
each video player setting's own description which platform it decides. Both came out of
the generated form offering settings the hand written page never had.
