# Pull request triage

The pull requests that were open when the rewrite started, diagnosed against the
code on both sides rather than against their descriptions. Rewrite pull requests
are tracked in [issue #114](https://github.com/streamyfin/jellyfin-plugin-streamyfin/issues/114)
and in [plan.md](plan.md), not here.

## #109, lockable auto subtitles on mute

Two lockable booleans, `autoSubtitlesOnMute` and `autoSubtitlesOnMuteAllowRestart`,
declared so the plugin can push and lock the app's mute behaviour. Eleven lines,
CodeRabbit found nothing, and the reasoning in the description is right: a key the
plugin does not declare resolves `locked` to `undefined`, so the lock can never
take effect.

**The keys do not match the app.** In `streamyfin/streamyfin` the setting is
`subtitlesOnMute`, a single boolean:

| Where | What |
|---|---|
| `utils/atoms/settings.ts:378` | `subtitlesOnMute: boolean` in the settings type |
| `utils/atoms/settings.ts:552` | default `false` |
| `components/settings/SubtitleToggles.tsx:442` | the switch, iOS only and not TV |
| `providers/NativePlayerProvider.tsx:1039` | the behaviour, native player only |

Neither `autoSubtitlesOnMute` nor anything resembling an allow restart setting
exists anywhere in the app. Merged as it stands, this pull request ships two keys
nothing reads, and the lock it is meant to enable still does nothing.

Three things had to be settled, and all three were, on 2026-08-25.

1. **Renamed.** `autoSubtitlesOnMute` and `autoSubtitlesOnMuteAllowRestart` became
   `subtitlesOnMute` and `subtitlesOnMuteAllowRestart`, which are the keys the app
   resolves.
2. **The second key exists now.** The app branch `feat/subtitles-on-mute` adds
   `subtitlesOnMuteAllowRestart` at `utils/atoms/settings.ts:384`, reads it in both
   players (`app/(auth)/player/direct-player.tsx:1359` and
   `providers/NativePlayerProvider.tsx:1120`), and offers it on phone and on TV. So
   the note above about the setting being native player and iOS only no longer
   holds either.
3. **The defaults agree.** `utils/atoms/settings.ts:558-559` is `true` and `false`,
   which is what the plugin now declares. Three tests in the plugin pin the key
   names, the defaults, and the fact that neither ships locked, so this cannot
   drift back quietly.

The `disabled` binding the description assumed is on the same app branch, at
`components/settings/SubtitleToggles.tsx:442` and `:459`, and on the TV screen at
`app/(auth)/(tabs)/(home)/settings.tv.tsx:1022` and `:1031`.

**That branch merged on 2026-08-27 as
[streamyfin#1900](https://github.com/streamyfin/streamyfin/pull/1900)**, so the app's
published `develop` now carries both keys, both defaults and the `disabled` bindings.
The plugin is no longer ahead of anything: the parity test compares
`subtitlesOnMuteAllowRestart` against the manifest like any other key, and the two
exceptions written for that branch are deleted. The feature is out on both sides.

## #81, Seerr webhook notifications

A `POST /streamyfin/notification/seerr` endpoint that receives Seerr webhooks and
turns them into push notifications: `MEDIA_PENDING`, `MEDIA_AUTO_APPROVED` and
`MEDIA_FAILED` to admins, `MEDIA_APPROVED`, `MEDIA_DECLINED` and `MEDIA_AVAILABLE`
to the requesting user, issue events filtered out. 755 lines, a mapper, a payload
model, and a new `Strings.zh-CN.resx`.

It has sat for nine months with **zero comments and zero reviews**. Not one person
said yes or no. That is the part worth fixing first, whatever the outcome.

The feature is real and users want it. What has to be settled:

- **Naming.** Everything in it says Jellyseerr. The project has moved to Seerr,
  which is what issue #95 is about. New code should not arrive already carrying
  the old name.
- **It hardcodes the event routing**, which is exactly what P4.4 replaces with
  declared events. Merging it adds surface that P4 then has to migrate. Holding it
  makes a contributor wait on a part that is five steps away.
- **A new locale.** `Strings.zh-CN.resx` is the first Chinese resource in the
  plugin. The plugin has no translation platform, unlike the app which uses
  Crowdin, so accepting it means accepting that someone maintains it by hand.
- **The endpoint carries `[Authorize]`.** A webhook cannot log in as a Jellyfin
  user, so this only works if the admin sets an authorization header in the Seerr
  webhook agent. That works, but it is undocumented in the pull request and it is
  the first thing anyone configuring it will hit.
- **It logs the full payload at debug level**, which includes the requester's
  username and email. `StreamyfinController.cs` serialises the whole webhook body
  into a debug line, so turning debug logging on writes other people's contact
  details into the server log.

Recommendation: take the feature, with the renaming, and accept that P4.4 will
reshape it. Nine months of silence is worse for the project than a migration cost
we already signed up for. The payload logging is not part of that cost: log the
notification type and the subject, not the body, before this merges. That is a
one line change and it is not something to inherit deliberately. Say all of this
on the pull request rather than leaving it open for another nine months.

## #71, TV sidebar links

`settings.tvSidebarLinks`, letting an admin declare custom TV sidebar entries
pointing at libraries or collections, each able to carry curated sections.

Close it. Three independent reasons:

- **The maintainer already said so.** Comment of 2026-06-17: "I think this PR need
  to be completely re-done since tv as change a lot."
- **Nothing consumes it.** There is no `tvSidebarLinks`, no `sidebarLinks` and no
  `SidebarLink` anywhere in the app. Merged, it is config an admin can write and
  no device will read.
- **It conflicts with `main`** and has since well before that comment.

There is a fourth reason to close rather than rebase: it reuses the existing
`Section` model, which is precisely the model P5.1 replaces with a discriminated
type. Rebasing it now means rebasing it again in P5.

Close with the reasoning, point at #114 and P5, and say the idea is wanted back
once the section model is settled and the TV app side exists. The contributor put
real work in; the close should read like a postponement, because that is what it
is.
