// Comparing what Jellyfin publishes against what this repository builds against.

// The first version of this lived in nuget-watch.yml as `cut -d. -f1 | sort -u`, which
// compares major numbers and nothing else. It works for the case it was written for, a
// whole new Jellyfin line appearing, and is blind to every other one: 12.1.0 was
// published on 2026-09-15 and the watch said nothing, because 12 was already known.
// Prereleases are the case that matters most here, since the first 13.0.0-rc is the
// moment a 13 target becomes possible at all.

// NuGet versions are semantic enough for this: numeric parts, then an optional
// prerelease suffix after a hyphen. Build metadata after a plus is not used by Jellyfin
// and is ignored.
// Shape checked before the numbers are read, the same reason next-version.js does it:
// Number('') is 0, so '', '1..2' and '-1.0' all parse as a valid version otherwise, and
// a feed entry nobody can install would be reported as one that outranks the build.
