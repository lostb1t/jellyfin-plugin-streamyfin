/// A section carried four nullable siblings, <c>items</c>, <c>nextUp</c>, <c>latest</c>
/// and <c>custom</c>, and nothing anywhere said they were exclusive. The app read them
/// as a cascade of ifs, so a section carrying two silently used whichever the cascade
/// tested first, and a section carrying none drew an empty row with a title. Adding a
/// kind meant adding a fifth sibling to every one of those cascades.
///
/// <para>
/// The kind is now declared. The payloads keep their names, because every copy of the
/// app in the field reads them and a plugin that renamed them would empty the home
/// screen of everyone who had not updated, but exactly one of them is allowed and the
