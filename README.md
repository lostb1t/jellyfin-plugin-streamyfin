## 📦 Installation

### Method 1: Via Jellyfin Dashboard (Recommended)

1. Open **Jellyfin Dashboard** → **Plugins** → **Catalog**
2. Click the **⚙️ Settings icon** (next to "Catalog" title)
3. Click **➕ Add** to add a new repository
4. Enter the repository URL:
   ```
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/streamyfin/jellyfin-plugin-streamyfin/main/manifest.json
   ```
5. Go back to **Catalog** and search for **"Streamyfin"**
6. Click **Install**
7. **Restart Jellyfin** to complete installation

One URL for every supported server. The plugin is built twice, once for Jellyfin
10.11 and once for Jellyfin 12, and both builds are listed in that file; your server
picks the one it can run and never sees the other. Upgrading your server from 10.11
to 12 needs nothing changed here, and the next update is simply the right build.

### Method 2: Manual Installation

Use this only when the catalogue is not an option, and give it the `meta.json` in
step 4 even though the plugin loads without one. Jellyfin does not refuse a folder
that has none: it reads the name and version out of the folder name instead. What it
cannot invent is the plugin's identity, so it uses the MD5 of the folder name as the
id, the server never matches that to the catalogue entry, and **the plugin never
receives an update again**. The file is what keeps it updatable.

1. Download the `.zip` for your Jellyfin version from
   [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/streamyfin/jellyfin-plugin-streamyfin/releases):
   `-jf11` for 10.11, `-jf12` for 12.
2. Create a folder named `Streamyfin_<version>` in your plugins directory:
   - **Linux**: `/var/lib/jellyfin/plugins/Streamyfin_0.70.0.0/`
   - **Windows**: `%AppData%\Jellyfin\Server\plugins\Streamyfin_0.70.0.0\`
   - **Docker**: `/config/plugins/Streamyfin_0.70.0.0/`
3. Extract **everything** from the zip into it, not only
   `Jellyfin.Plugin.Streamyfin.dll`. The other assemblies beside it are required,
   and without them Jellyfin logs "Failed to load assembly" and disables the
   plugin.
4. Add a `meta.json` in the same folder, keeping the `guid` exactly as it is since
   that is the whole point, and using the `targetAbi` of the line you downloaded
   (`10.11.9.0` for `-jf11`, `12.0.0.0` for `-jf12`):

   ```json
   {
     "guid": "1e9e5d38-6e67-4615-8719-e98a5c34f004",
     "name": "Streamyfin",
     "version": "0.70.0.0",
     "targetAbi": "12.0.0.0",
     "status": "Active",
     "autoUpdate": false,
     "assemblies": []
   }
   ```

   That is the `-jf12` file. For `-jf11`, the same line reads
   `"targetAbi": "10.11.9.0"`. Declaring an ABI higher than your server has it
   refuse the plugin, which is what copying this one unchanged onto a 10.11 server
   would do.

5. **Restart Jellyfin**

> **Jellyfin 10.11.9 or later, or Jellyfin 12.** 10.11.9 is the floor for the
> 10.11 line rather than 10.11.0, because `IUserManager.Users` became
> `GetUsers()` inside that patch line. An older server refuses the plugin rather
> than loading it, and keeps running.

### Unstable builds

Work in progress, published so it can be tried on a real server before it is
released. These are builds of the `develop` branch: they are not a release, they
have not been through a release's checks, and one of them can break something the
last release did correctly.

Add this URL the same way as above, beside the one you already have:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/streamyfin/jellyfin-plugin-streamyfin/main/manifest-unstable.json
```

An unstable build is numbered above the release it follows: after 0.68.1.0 they are
0.68.1.1, 0.68.1.2 and so on, counting commits. The next release, 0.69.0.0, is above
all of them, so **removing the unstable repository puts you back on the stable path
by itself**: the next release is offered as an ordinary update. Nothing has to be
uninstalled.

Keep both repositories and you are on the unstable channel, since its builds are the
newer number until the next release goes out. That is the point of it, and it is the
reason to remove the URL once you are done testing.

> Running Jellyfin 13 unstable? The 12 build is what installs there, and the same
> `manifest.json` above serves it: `targetAbi` is the oldest server a build accepts
> rather than the only one. A build of its own will come when Jellyfin 13 needs one.

## 🤝 Integration Guides

### Seerr Integration (formerly Jellyseerr)
Enable automatic authentication for your users:
1. Set your Seerr server URL in plugin settings
2. Ensure Seerr is configured for **Jellyfin authentication**
3. Users will be automatically logged in when opening Seerr from the app

Optionally set the **Seerr API Key** (Seerr Settings > General) to let Streamyfin sign users in without a password. This also covers Quick Connect and OIDC logins, which have no password.

**Warning:** every authenticated Jellyfin user can read this key, and it grants full admin access to the Seerr API. Only set it on servers where you trust all users. Requires a Seerr version with the `/user/jellyfin/{id}` route and a Streamyfin version with API-key sign-in.

### Streamystats Integration
Get personalized recommendations:
1. Set your Streamystats server URL
2. Enable movie and/or series recommendations
3. Optionally enable promoted watchlists

### Marlin Search Integration
Enhanced search capabilities:
1. Set Marlin as your default search engine
2. Configure your Marlin server URL
3. Users will use Marlin for all app searches
